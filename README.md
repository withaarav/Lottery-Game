# Lottery Spinner Game

Genre: Interactive Luck-based Game

Description:
The Lottery Spinner Game is an engaging, luck-based game that combines the thrill of betting with the suspense of a spinning wheel. Players start with $2000 and place bets on numbers from 0 to 9 using interactive sliders. Once bets are placed, the spinner comes to life, accompanied by sound effects, creating an immersive experience as players wait to see if their chosen number will land. If their number matches, they win nine times their bet, giving them the chance to grow their in-game balance.

The game includes interactive colour-changing number blocks that react dynamically to player interaction, adding a visually stimulating element to the gameplay. A series of sounds further heightens the excitement, with a spinner sound while the wheel spins, a celebratory sound for winning, and a different tone for losing.
